# Overview

This project focuses on predicting the prominent piece of clothing among predefined classes using the Fashion-MNIST dataset. The Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) implemented, based on the LeNet-5 architecture model, demonstrates significant accuracy, achieving 95.08% on the training set and 92.37% on the testing set.

# In order to run this experiment please follow these instructions:
Please do not create subfolders, as this project has been created using each file from the same repository.

## (OPTIONAL) How to convert Fashion-MNIST dataset into CSV file
As one of the files is too large to upload directly, you can follow this step:
From a terminal prompt, please run:

python3 convert.py

## How to run jupyter notebook
### Install jupyter notebook:
From a terminal prompt, please run:

pip install notebook

### Launch jupyter notebook:
Opening a terminal prompt and being located in the current working folder containing this project, please run:

jupyter notebook

### Open jupyter notebook file:
From a web browser (Mozilla Firefox, Google ...), open the localhost url shown in the terminal prompt. This should looks like this : "http://localhost:8888/"

Please click on the jupyter notebook file ("project_work.ipynb") to launch a kernel instance.

### Running jupyter notebook file:
Once the kernel is started and connected, from top page to foot page, please click on "Run" button for all cells of code.

### Errors in first cell when importing librairies ?
If there is an error in the first cell please check that all packages are correctly installed and up-to-date on your device.

If any unexpected error occurs when running the code, please consider copy pasting all code on a regular python file. All outputs presented in the jupyter notebook are shown in the written report.

Also, if you haven't ran all cells yet, you can still look at the previous generated output.
